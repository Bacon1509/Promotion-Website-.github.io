I am promoting the game "Escape From Tarkov" it is a hardcore apocalyptic survival shooter game. The main play cycle of the game is looting items to get better weaponry and armor, build your hideout to unlock crafting and various other benefits. And complete tasks/quests for the main eight traders in the game, Prapor, Therapist, Fence, Skier, Peacekeeper, Mechanic, Ragman and Jaeger. there is no main goal in the game, except for getting the highest capacity secure container, which requires you to get every task done and play for a very long time. The games claim to fame is its hardcore feeling as everywhere you go is danger, whether it be another player looking to take your loot for their own, or the AI "Scavs, Rogues, Cultists, Raiders and Scav Bosses," The latter, meaning a certain demise if unprepared. And this feeling of being in danger for the first bit of the game, to BEING the danger to others later, is quite enjoyable for its players.
